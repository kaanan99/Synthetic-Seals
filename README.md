# Synthetic Seals

## Background
An issue faced during the automatic seal counting project was the lack of data. More specifically the lack of 150x150 sub-images contains seals. To solve this problem, I have decided to generate additional data utilizing a DCGAN.

**NOTE:**
This repository is missing the training data used to train the DCGAN

## How to run
* This project utilizes Python 3.10 <br>
* Utilizing CUDA is highly recommended (More information can be found here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) <br> <br>
**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
